    <p>
    I am Chen Griner, a recent Ph.D. graduate in Communication Engineering, having completed 
    my studies in 2024. During my doctoral research, I focused on topics such as wireless communication, 
    signal processing, and network optimization. I published four peer-reviewed articles in respected journals, contributing 
    meaningful insights to the field. My work combined both theoretical modeling and practical applications, aiming to solve real-world 
    communication challenges. I actively collaborated with other researchers and participated in international conferences. With a strong academic 
    background and hands-on research experience, I am now looking to apply my 
    knowledge in academia or the tech industry, where I can continue to innovate and grow.
